# Front-end web development with react

React is an open source Javascript library for creating user interfaces with the aim of facilitating the development of application applications on a single page. This is a repository of my progress in Course at Coursera. 

### What did I learn in the course? : 

* React
* Reactstrap 
* Redux
* Fetch 
 
 ### How the final project looks like: 
 This is the final project, as you can see, in this course we created a lot of components and we used redux, fetch and react animations. So here is the result of a long work with the teacher of Frontend web development with React in Coursera.
